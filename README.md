These recipes behave similar to esorex recipes. Can be invoked with specifying the option, `--recipe-dir=${PATH_TO_RECIPES}`. 

The recipes require `esorexplugin.py` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variable needs to point to where this file lives.
This is provided with `esoreflex` in the `esoreflex/esoreflex/python/` directory. For convenience, I added this file in this directory.
